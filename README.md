# Window Automation for Climate Control
## ECE Sensors Hackathon | Team Broadway Bound

Our project aims to reduce energy use in climate control by automating window operation based on temperature and humidity readings. 

This project utilizes an ESP-32 chip and two temperature sensors to compare the temperature of the interior and exterior of a room. Based on a user's input desired temperature, the system calculates whether the window should be opened or closed to best react to their needs. If necessary, the system then changes the state of the window by using a servo motor. 

To use the system: download the folder "hackathon". Upload the project, using file 'main' as a basis, to an ESP32-C3 chip. Follow listed pinouts. Temperature can then be selected using the rotary control.
